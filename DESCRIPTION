Description: This package provides functions to assign standardized diagnosis 
    using the Banff Classification (Category 1 to 6 diagnoses, including Acute 
    and Chronic active T-cell mediated rejection as well as Active, 
    Chronic active, and Chronic antibody mediated rejection). The main function 
    considers a minimal dataset containing biopsies information in a specific 
    format (described by a data dictionary), verifies its content and format 
    (based on the data dictionary), assign diagnoses, and create a summary 
    report.
